# Hank's Weather Dashboard

In this assignment, I created a weather dashboard web application using the OpenWeather API.

A web application that allows users to search for the current and future weather conditions of a city, as well as view a 5-day forecast. The search history is also displayed, allowing users to quickly access previously searched cities.


To use the application, simply open the webpage and enter a city name in the search bar. Click the search button or press enter to retrieve the current weather and 5-day forecast for the city. The city is also added to the search history. Click on a previously searched city in the search history to view its current and future weather conditions again.
